# VR BEEVA Labs experiment

This project is a virtual visit to BEEVA Labs' offices. It has been used for testing different UX solutions for interacting with the environment with only the user gaze as input for all actions. It is based on [Salvador Valle](https://medium.com/@salvador.valle_71154)'s work on mobile VR interactions. There is an article on the virtual visit to BEEVA Labs available [here](https://labs.beeva.com/a-virtual-visit-to-beeva-labs-6fe3f6add065).
